//TODO: MED (MAJOR) Convert the deviation form from redux from to normal form
//TODO: HIGH (Medium) Fix error handling for the Task Detail form 
//TODO: HIGH (Medium) Clean up / remove redux form implementation

Next step :

2. Save new deviation
3. Check all other fucntionality works closed dev etc
4. Add form validation

Then remove other uses of redux form

Change Over
-------------------
1. User names are in consistent and the db will need to be modified.
Note: Work around in the getAllUsers controller\users to create a fullname if one is missing
users will still not be able to log in uptil the paswords are adjusted.
